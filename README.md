# Conclusion 1
Teams of employees who have high daily targets tend to achieve higher productivity. Teams with daily targets set 10% higher than average (70%), managed to achieve good productivity targets. In addition, a lower number of design revisions is positively correlated with higher productivity. The data showed that teams with minimal design changes had only 10% higher productivity than teams with frequent revisions.

# Conclusion 2
Data shows that productivity decreases as overtime increases. Teams working more than 0.6 experience a 20% decrease in productivity and will continue to decline. This shows that fatigue and work overload reduce labor efficiency. In addition, teams that spend more than 0.4 per day on a single task experience a 20% decrease in productivity. However, the optimal number of employees in a team also plays an important role. Teams with a moderate number of workers showed stable productivity.

# Conclusion 3
High incentives have proven to be effective in improving team productivity performance. Teams that received performance bonuses showed a significant increase in productivity. In addition, keeping idle time low is also crucial. Data shows that employee teams with no idle time have 26% higher productivity than teams with idle time. By reducing unproductive time, employees can focus better on their tasks.
